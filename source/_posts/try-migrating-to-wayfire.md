## Preface

Recently, I want to migrate to `windows manager`, and I attempt to leran `wayfire`. In the past, I have heard and tried wayfire, but I didn't migrate to it because I need a GUI file manager.

Now, I want to change my habit to adapt `tui file manager` for focusing on work. Another reason is that `DE` takes up too much memory and has some small bugs from time to time.

So, I chose wayfire, a cascading window manager, not tiling, I prefer cascading to tiling.

## About [Wayfire](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire)

Acording to its self introduction:

> Wayfire is a 3D Wayland compositor, inspired by Compiz and based on wlroots.

> It aims to create a customizable, extendable and lightweight environment without sacrificing its appearance.
